I'm a senior undergraduate student from the [Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science](https://www.engineering.columbia.edu/), [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/). I’m pursuing a B.S. in [Computer Science](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/) with a minor in [Applied Mathematics](https://www.apam.columbia.edu/programs/applied-mathematics).

I'm a Software Engineer Intern at [Square](https://squareup.com/us/en) ([Block Inc.](https://block.xyz/)), where I'm building a Looker-based MCP server for AI Agent [Goose](https://github.com/block/goose), integrating our Bellhop data-platform tool for seamless self-service access checks, and automating large-scale audits with Prefect workflows. Before that, I architected serverless backends at Rebel using Python, Firebase, and Google Cloud, and designed data-streaming pipelines at WebEye, processing millions of records daily.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Venkat Venkatasubramanian](https://www.cheme.columbia.edu/faculty/venkat-venkatasubramanian) of CRIS Lab from [Department of Chemical Engineering](https://www.cheme.columbia.edu/), Columbia University. I was advised by [Prof. Baishakhi Ray](https://www.rayb.info/), [Prof. Itsik Pe'er](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~itsik/), and [Prof. Luis Gravano](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~gravano/) from [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/), Columbia University.

You can find my CV here: [Crystal Su's Resume](../assets/Resume_Crystal_Su.pdf).

**I’m actively seeking Full Time Roles & Master's degree starting Summer/Fall 2026.**
