I'm a senior undergraduate student from the [Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science](https://www.engineering.columbia.edu/), [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/). Iâ€™m pursuing a B.S. in [Computer Science](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/) with a minor in [Applied Mathematics](https://www.apam.columbia.edu/programs/applied-mathematics).

I'm a Software Engineer Intern at [Square](https://squareup.com/us/en) ([Block Inc.](https://block.xyz/)), where I'm building a Looker-based MCP server for AI Agent Goose, integrating our Bellhop data-platform tool for seamless self-service access checks, and automating large-scale audits with Prefect workflows. Before that, I architected serverless backends at Rebel using Python, Firebase, and Google Cloud, and designed data-streaming pipelines at WebEye, processing millions of records daily.
